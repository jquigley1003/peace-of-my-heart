      <p>
        At Peace of My Heart (POMH), your puppy will be trained and socialized in a home environment using short term/long 
        term crating. This method is used to aid in potty training and being happy and relaxed 
        in a crate. The puppy will stay with me for four weeks, and can come home for two 
        weekends (recommended) during the four week period. If the puppy does come home during the four week 
        period, it is recommended that the puppy be picked up and returned to his/her home by POMH
        <a [routerLink]="['/services-policies/pet-transport']">(see Pet Transport Service for description and rates)</a> 
        to aid in reducing separation anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
        The importance of starting your puppy's training at this age is to maximize the puppy's prime 
        'imprinting' phase. The lessons and experiences a puppy has at this age will imprint the puppy 
        for the rest of its life. So, the more positive experiences the puppy has, the better well-adjusted 
        adult dog it will become.
      </p>
      <p>
        The behaviors targeted during training are: crate training, 
        potty training, bite-inhibition, leash walking, recall, proper socialization and 
        handle-ability. Other experiences your puppy will have while in training are exposure 
        to other dogs (safe, well behaved and fully vaccinated), visits to restaurants and coffee shops 
        (where allowed), bathing and nails weekly, and field trips to aid in a wide variety of 
        experiences outside of the home. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A puppy enrolled in the program will receive the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Training treats
        </li>
        <li>
          Occupational therapy treats during crate training
        </li>
        <li>
          One bath per week
        </li>
        <li>
          Option for Pet Transport Service to and from your home for weekend visits (extra rates apply)
        </li>
        <li>
          Off-site training exercises and excursions
        </li>
        <li>
          Four 1-hour follow-up training sessions (with the owner) after the 
          puppy completes the four week in-home training. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The follow-up training sessions are your responsibility to schedule and must be scheduled within 
        four weeks of completing this puppy training/socialization course. You will also receive a training 
        journal at the completion of the four week training course. This will aid you and your puppy in your 
        continued training efforts.
