          Our Mission: Strive for exceptional customer service, embrace our remarkable love of animals, 
          and be known for superior individual care.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone who knows me is aware that Xena and Cardiff are my kids. They go everywhere with me. Because of this, 
          I had a vision of a place where I would feel comfortable leaving my wonderful canine companions when I 
          had to travel without them. Realizing that I wasnâ€™t the only one who felt this way, I began the process of 
          transforming my vision into a reality. Peace of My Heart was born!
        </p>
        <p>Whether for training or boarding, the pets in my care are not just left to be cooped up in a kennel, but are guests, 
          like a bed & breakfast inn for dogs. Spending individual time with your pet goes a long way to relieve their stress, 
          and helps put the pet parents at ease. While you are away, give your pet the gift of Peace of My Heart!</p>
